### UX TODO:

- Update the app icon

### Frontend TODO:

- Remove that fab button from the home screen

### Middleware TODO:

- Create a Deck object to hold an ArrayList of Flashcards
	- Add an attribute for the title of the deck
	- Maybe add an attribute to hold the index of the last viewed flash card
- Maybe modify the Flashcard object so that each flashcard has a unique id
- Create a custom adapter to display each of the decks in the category activity
	- The 3rd Udacity course in the android basics course covers making custom adapters in the Miwok app
- Make an event for the fab button in the flashcard creator activity to create a new flashcard object and add it to the current deck
- Maybe make a settings object to hold things like the selected theme colors
	- Maybe it can hold an ArrayList of Decks
- Once the custom adapter for the categoty activity is done, make it so clicking on a deck will open the flashcard viewer activity with the corresponding flashcards from that deck
	- Add events for the previous and next buttons
- Create an adapter for the flashcard creator activity as well
- Get all this stuff to save to the database somehow
